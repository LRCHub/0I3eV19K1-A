The midnight drunks go walking
Happy, looking sad, and talking destiny
This is what the city pays for, I can see
The neon lights resist the fight against separation anxiety
This is what the city pays for, I can see

The dream they sell
I'm hooked; I'm overwhelmed again
And I wish that I could say the days alleviate
This artificial pain I never thought that I'd be feeling at this age

But the drunks don't go to sleep
They linger just like you and me
This is what the city pays for; what I need

What's happened to me?
And then I have those dreams, too
The ones where I'm running around like a fool
To make things better for you

Like the good storyteller
You once knew me as
Try to hold it in my head
That no time has passed
Since I stood in circles with automatic friends
Not worried that the means justified the end

'Cause life without love
Keeps my eyes wide
And my house stays clean
When I don't let people inside
