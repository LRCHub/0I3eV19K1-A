212 degrees rushing forcefully
Through my veins and arteries
No chance of getting sleep
As you soundly rest
With the state I'm in
So far in disrepair
You put me here
(You put me here)

You're indifferent
I've been wearing thin
Starved of apology
This hunger's crippling
I can hardly speak
Lips are trembling
So far in disrepair
You put me here

You're a storyteller
What you buried deep resurfaced
You're a liar, liar, liar (I'm losin' it 'cause)
No secret that you kept ever fucked me up like this
Storyteller
You're a liar, liar, liar

Red hands, losing face
Nervous stuttering
You lost grip of every good thing
You've fallen off at the deep end
I was so naive
You said, honestly
"I swear, I never knew"
But now I see right through

You put me here
Now I see right through you

You're a storyteller
What you buried deep resurfaced
You're a liar, liar, liar (I'm losin' it 'cause)
No secret that you kept ever fucked me up like this

You're a storyteller
(You put me here)
You're a liar, liar, liar
No secret that you kept ever fucked me up like this
Storyteller
You're a liar, liar, liar
