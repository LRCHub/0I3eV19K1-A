Holding my breath as I patiently wait
What could come next
You turned on a light in my gullible mind
I let you inside
Just like a child imagining what could be
I let it run wild
I was naive
It's too good to be true
Still I believed
You told me what I wanted to hear
Your words paint pictures so sincere
Well some things aren't as they appear
The fantasy is over
Storyteller storyteller
Telling tales so tall
A witness so false
Storyteller storyteller
You lead your audience on
For your fiction they fall
Believing the fraud
Innocence lost
I was safe and secure
Now it's all gone
Sorry I lied
Is that all you can say
Sorry I tried
I was convinced
By the sweetest of talk
Not to resist
You'll be exposed
By the people you played
Watch it unfold
You told me what I wanted to hear
Your words paint pictures so sincere
Well some things aren't as they appear
The fantasy is over
Storyteller storyteller
Telling tales so tall
A witness so false
Storyteller storyteller
You lead your audience on
For your fiction they fall
Believing the fraud
You told me what I wanted to hear
Your words paint pictures so sincere
