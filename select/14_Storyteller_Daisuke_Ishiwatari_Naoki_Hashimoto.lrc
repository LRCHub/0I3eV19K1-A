[00:24.65] Warm in the day, have a good time
[00:26.90] Cool in the night, have a good time
[00:29.01] That's what I'll keep on saying
[00:31.14] Till I lose my mind
[00:33.50] Feel like a bird in the sea breeze
[00:35.84] Shine like the moon in the night sky
[00:37.72] Can you believe that
[00:39.37] Till the end of your life
[00:51.87] 
[00:42.31] Go, with some bucks in to her room
[00:44.53] That's enough for satisfaction
[00:46.62] (We) already know how to have fun
[00:49.13] No need of explanation
[01:00.13] 
[00:53.51] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[00:55.84] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[00:58.08] Surely that doesn't matter
[00:59.90] Oh Storyteller
[01:02.28] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[01:04.58] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[01:06.86] Oh no it doesn't matter
[01:08.84] The song that we will never lose
[01:24.84] 
[01:15.90] That I'd never be taller,
[01:18.04] That she'll love some one other
[01:20.01] Just cause you think you know me
[01:22.29] Don't try to change my mind
[01:24.55] Happiness of seeing a newborn
[01:27.02] All futures that could be dreamed of
[01:29.12] Everything we'll be judged
[01:30.94] By our mortal life
[01:39.94] 
[01:33.28] Go! With some rainbows in our hands
[01:35.94] Grey papers are not in need for
[01:37.88] Don't mind if we make mistake
[01:40.24] Make jokes of them, have a laugh
[01:56.24] 
[01:44.64] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[01:46.99] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[01:49.19] Please spread these words forever
[01:51.25] Oh Storyteller
[01:53.54] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[01:55.81] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[01:58.03] How can it not matter?
[01:59.96] The songs we lost one by one
[02:13.96] 
[02:24.55] Look around
[02:26.65] Run around
[02:28.50] There's nothing left to smile for
[02:33.47] Look around
[02:35.50] Run around
[02:37.49] There's nothing left to cry for
[02:52.99] 
[02:44.66] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[02:46.88] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[02:49.37] Don't ever let it fadeout
[02:51.12] Oh Storyteller
[02:53.52] Ooh! What's so worth nothing
[02:55.87] Ooh! What's worth a bad thing
[02:58.06] There is no need for sorrow
[03:00.04] Great songs will never die
